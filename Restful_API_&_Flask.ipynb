        "1 A RESTful API, also known as a REST API, is an Application Programming Interface (API) that adheres to the architectural style principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). REST is a set of guidelines for building web services that are lightweight, scalable, and maintainable.\n",

        "17 Flask automatically creates a static endpoint to serve static files (like HTML templates, CSS stylesheets, JS files, and images). For example, to serve an image, copy the image into the \"static\" folder of the Flask project.\n",
